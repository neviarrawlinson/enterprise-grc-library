# ISO 27001:2022 to NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Mapping

This reference provides a practical alignment between ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A controls and the NIST CSF Core Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). It is intended for organizations leveraging both frameworks or transitioning between them.

## Overview

| ISO 27001 Annex A Control | NIST CSF Function | NIST CSF Category/Outcome |
|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| A.5.7 Threat Intelligence | Identify          | ID.RA-1: Asset vulnerabilities are identified and documented |
| A.6.1 Access Control       | Protect           | PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified |
| A.6.4 Privileged Access    | Protect           | PR.AC-4: Access permissions and authorizations are managed |
| A.8.9 Configuration Mgmt   | Protect           | PR.IP-1: A baseline configuration is established and maintained |
| A.5.23 Information Security for Use of Cloud Services | Protect | PR.IP-3: Configuration change control processes are in place |
| A.8.16 Monitoring Activities | Detect           | DE.CM-1: The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events |
| A.5.28 Legal, Regulatory & Contractual | Identify | ID.GV-1: Organizational governance is established and maintained |
| A.5.30 Suppliers and Partners | Identify       | ID.SC-3: Suppliers and third-party partners are identified and managed |
| A.8.27 Response Planning  | Respond           | RS.RP-1: Response plan is executed during or after an incident |
| A.8.28 Recovery Planning  | Recover           | RC.RP-1: Recovery processes and procedures are executed and maintained |

*This is a simplified view. Detailed mappings may depend on organizational context and control implementation.*
