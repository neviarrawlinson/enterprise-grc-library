# Module 9: Risk and Incident Response

## Overview

This module focuses on the essential processes for identifying, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity and operational incidents. Learners will study how to integrate risk assessments, incident triage, RCA (root cause analysis), and governance actions into a unified response plan.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Understand the components of a Risk Management Lifecycle
- Differentiate between security incidents and broader business incidents
- Conduct a basic Root Cause Analysis (RCA) using structured methods
- Align incident response with compliance requirements (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA)
- Document corrective actions and track risk reduction over time

---

## Topics Covered

- Risk Identification and Scoring
- Incident Lifecycle: Detect, Contain, Remediate, Recover
- RCA Techniques:
  - 5 Whys
  - Fishbone Diagram
  - Postmortem Frameworks
- Governance Role in Incident Oversight
- Example: How Change Management intersects with Incident Response
- Risk Register Integration and Lessons Learned

---

## Activities

1. Review a real-world security incident case study and complete an RCA.
2. Draft an incident response checklist for your organization or a fictional company.
3. Add an entry to a sample risk register and assign a risk treatment plan.
4. Create a mock incident postmortem and identify root causes vs. contributing factors.

## Lab

> Hands-On: Use the RCA Toolkit template to generate a complete postmortem for a fictional incident involving a service outage or data breach. Include:

- Timeline of events
- Root cause and contributing factors
- Risk rating before and after
- Remediation steps
