## Section 2: Risk Assessment Methodologies

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Qualitative | Uses categories (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to rank risk |
| Quantitative | Uses financial or numerical values to assess risk (e.g., ALE, SLE) |
| Hybrid | Combines both approaches |

### Tools to Explore:
- Risk Matrix
- Heat Map
- Risk Register

## Section 3: Risk Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| ISO 31000 | Global standard for risk management |
| NIST SP 800-30 | Guide for conducting risk assessments |
| FAIR | Quantitative risk modeling framework (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) |

## Section 5: Activities and Exercises

✅ Activity: Use the provided **Risk Register Template** to log 3 hypothetical IT risks.

✅ Reflect: Which risk assessment methodology would work best in your organization and why?

✅ Discussion Prompt: What’s the difference between mitigating and transferring risk?

---

## Practice Assignment

Complete a **Mini Risk Assessment**:
- Choose a GRC-related scenario (e.g., a SaaS tool storing PII)
- Identify at least 3 risks
- Rate them using qualitative assessment
- Suggest treatments

Save your assessment using the template provided in the `templates/` folder.

---

## Summary

Effective risk management allows organizations to make informed decisions about security, compliance, and operations. GRC professionals must know how to assess, document, and monitor risks as a core skill.
