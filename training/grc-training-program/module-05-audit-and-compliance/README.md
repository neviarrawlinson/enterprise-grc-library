## Section 1: What Is an Audit?

An **audit** is a formal inspection of controls, policies, and evidence to verify compliance with a defined framework or regulation.

### Types of Audits

|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Internal  | Conducted by internal audit/compliance teams  | Quarterly ISO audits |
| External  | Performed by third-party firms                | SOC 2 or HIPAA audit |

## Section 2: Compliance Basics

Compliance ensures that your organization adheres to laws, standards, or internal policies. Key compliance components include:

- Control implementation
- Documentation (e.g., SOPs, policies)
- Evidence tracking
- Reporting and corrective actions

---

## Section 3: Audit Evidence & Artifacts

Auditors look for evidence that controls are working effectively. Examples include:

- Change management records
- Access reviews
- Policy sign-off logs
- Security awareness training reports
- Risk assessments

### Best Practices for Audit Evidence
- Timestamped
- Easily accessible
- Stored securely (SharePoint, Confluence, etc.)
- Linked to specific control IDs

---

## Section 4: The Audit Cycle

1. **Planning** – Define scope, controls, and timeline
2. **Request List (PBCs)** – Auditor shares list of artifacts needed (PBC = Provided By Client)
3. **Fieldwork** – Review of documentation, interviews, walkthroughs
4. **Findings** – Issues or gaps identified
5. **Remediation** – Fix gaps and share follow-up evidence
6. **Final Report** – Audit opinion, readiness level, or certification granted

## Section 5: Control Testing

Control testing involves verifying:
- The control exists
- It’s implemented correctly
- It operates as intended

Methods include:
- Observation
- Walkthroughs
- Sampling
- Documentation review

---

## Section 6: Interacting with Auditors

Tips for working with auditors:
- Be organized and responsive
- Avoid vague answers — show evidence
- Use trackers (e.g., PBC Tracker) to manage requests
- Be honest about gaps, but have a remediation plan

✅ [Use this template](../../audits/pbc-tracker-template.md) to track audit requests and response status.

---

## Section 7: Activities and Practice

✅ Review a SOC 2 or ISO 27001 checklist

✅ Practice building a mini PBC tracker for 5 controls:
- Identify control
- Evidence type
- Owner
- Artifact location

✅ Review 3 policies and link them to associated controls

## Summary

Audits and compliance efforts keep your GRC program accountable. By preparing evidence early and working proactively with auditors, you can maintain a state of audit readiness year-round.
