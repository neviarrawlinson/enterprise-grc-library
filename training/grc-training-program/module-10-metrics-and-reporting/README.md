# Module 10: GRC Metrics and Reporting

## Overview

Effective GRC programs rely on transparent, actionable metrics to drive accountability, inform leadership, and measure control effectiveness. This module introduces foundational concepts for developing GRC dashboards, KPIs, audit reporting, and continuous improvement mechanisms.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for GRC programs
- Design reports that communicate compliance posture to stakeholders
- Build basic metrics dashboards using templates or BI tools
- Translate audit, risk, and control data into actionable insights
- Establish reporting cadences and escalation protocols

---

## Topics Covered

- What Makes a Good GRC Metric?
- Control Effectiveness vs. Control Design
- Risk Heat Maps and Risk Appetite
- Reporting for Different Audiences (execs, ops, audit, regulators)
- GRC Dashboard Examples (change management, audit readiness, incident response)
- Common Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Jira Dashboards, Excel, Confluence

---

## Activities

1. Define KPIs for a sample GRC program (e.g., change success rate, audit finding closure).
2. Mock up a simple risk dashboard using spreadsheet templates.
3. Create a stakeholder-specific report for audit committee vs. internal team.
4. Set up a reporting calendar for recurring compliance reviews.

## Lab

> Hands-On: Use the GRC Dashboard Template to create a one-page summary report for:

- Open audit items
- Risk register status
- Change failure rate
- Security incident metrics

Explain who the audience is and how often they should receive the report.
