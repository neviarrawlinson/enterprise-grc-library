# GRC Training Program: Final Project

## Overview

This capstone project is designed to reinforce everything you’ve learned in the GRC Training Program. You’ll simulate a GRC consultant engagement or internal governance role by creating a portfolio of documents that demonstrate applied GRC skills.

You are encouraged to publish these artifacts in your own GitHub repo or use them as part of your professional portfolio.
