## Section 2: Anatomy of a Governance Policy

Every policy should include:

- **Title**
- **Purpose**: Why this policy exists
- **Scope**: Who/what is impacted
- **Policy Statement**: Core rules and positions
- **Roles and Responsibilities**
- **Exceptions and Violations**
- **References**: Frameworks, laws, other policies
- **Document Control**: Version, owner, approval date

> Tip: Store policies in a centralized repository like Confluence, SharePoint, or your GRC platform.

## Section 3: SOP Best Practices

SOPs should be:

- **Actionable**: Step-by-step and easy to follow
- **Assigned**: Each step has a responsible role
