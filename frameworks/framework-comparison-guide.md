## Key Use Cases

- **ISO 27001**: Ideal for organizations seeking international recognition and a certifiable ISMS.
- **NIST CSF**: Best for aligning cybersecurity strategy and risk practices without formal certification.
- **SOC 2**: Common among SaaS providers and tech companies looking to assure customers of secure practices.

---

## Framework Integration Tip

Many organizations combine these frameworks by using:

- **ISO 27001** as the overarching ISMS
- **NIST CSF** to drive cybersecurity maturity
- **SOC 2** for customer-facing control attestation

This multi-framework strategy supports regulatory compliance, stakeholder trust, and long-term scalability.
